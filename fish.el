;; fish.el --- Show a flappy fish in the mode line -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Matthew Monjarrez
;; Version: 1.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1"))
;; Keywords: games, fun
;; URL: https://github.com/mattmonja/flappy-fish

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package shows a flapping fish in your mode-line that moves
;; according to your buffer position. The right-pointing fish is only
;; displayed in the active buffer.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   1. Put this file in your load-path
;;   2. Add (require 'fish) to your init file
;;   3. Set up the fish in your mode-line:
;;
;;   (require 'fish)
;;   (fish-start-timer)  ;; or (fish-start-timer 'swimming)
;;   (setq global-mode-string '("" fish-mode-line-string))
;;
;;   The fish supports two display styles:
;;   - 'static: Shows a static fish that flaps in place (default)
;;   - 'swimming: Shows a fish that swims across the mode line based on buffer position
